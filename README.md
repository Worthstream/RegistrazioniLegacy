This repository contains efforts to clean up and modernize an existing legacy PHP application (or two twin applications, really). The main goals here are to address security vulnerabilities, improve accessibility, and refine application logic while migrating the codebase closer to contemporary best practices.

## Why this project?
Legacy PHP codebases are notoriously difficult to work with, often containing outdated patterns and hidden risks. This project focuses on making the system more secure and user-friendly without throwing everything away and starting from scratch.
Also, i love working with legacy code!

## Approach
Given the limited time budget, a full rewrite isnâ€™t feasible. Instead, the work is focused on targeted fixes and incremental improvements. These include:
- Patching security flaws that could compromise the system.
- Enhancing accessibility to improve usability for all users.
- Rationalizing application logic for clearer, safer behavior.
- Slowly refactoring components to adopt a more modern PHP style.

## Audience

If you are here as a potential employer or collaborator, feel free to reach out to discuss how legacy PHP projects can be effectively managed and improved without costly rewrites.
